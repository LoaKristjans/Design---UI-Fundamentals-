# Design-UI-Fundamentals
For this project I kept in mind all 8 points made in the guide.  
**Whitespace** - I played with the text, images and background boxes. Made sure	padding, margin of header, line height of text was fitting.   
**Alignment** - Played around with the lines and tried to position them well.  
**Contrast** - Choose vibrent colors for the boxes behinde the photos on a non-vibrent background which gives contrast.  
**Color** - Kept the colors of the text simple and black but played around with the all around colorpalet.  
**Scale** - Spread around the images and text so it wasn't narrow in any way.   
**Typography** - Found two fonts that fit well together on Google fonts. On that website there is an option to choose popular pairings, so I choose Roberto and a popular pairing with that one was Lobster.  
**Visual Hierarchy / Proximity** - Some elements are more important then others, kept that in mind with the position and sixe of the text and images.
